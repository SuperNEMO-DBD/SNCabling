\section{Addressing objects}

\subsection{Format of a CaloSignal label}

Each label used for calorimeter signal cabling uses  the following
format:

\begin{center}
  \fbox{\texttt{X:}$id_1$.$id_2$\dots$id_n$}
\end{center}
\noindent  where \texttt{X}  is a  single letter  which describes  the
category  of the  labelled  object,  and the  $id_1$.$id_2$\dots$id_n$
sequence is the unique address of the object within its category.  The
$id_x$ tokens are positive integers (possibly zero).  The \emph{colon}
character is  used to separate  the category letter from  the address.
The  sequence  of  identifiers  in  the  address  use  the  \emph{dot}
character as a separator.


\subsection{Front-end crates, boards and channels}

Frontend crates  belonging to the  CaloSignal system are  installed in
racks  number  2 and  3  on  the  electronics  platform.  A  crate  is
identified with an unique ID,  namely a number ranging from \texttt{0}
to \texttt{2}.  We  propose to label a given crate  with the following
scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{C:$crate$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$crate$} is the number of the crate (positive integer).
\vskip     10pt    \par\noindent     Examples:    \fbox{\texttt{C:0}},
\fbox{\texttt{C:1}}.   \par Conventionally,  crate \texttt{0}  manages
PMTs from  the main  wall on the  \emph{Italy} side,  crate \texttt{1}
manages PMTs  from the main wall  on the \emph{France} side  and crate
\texttt{2} manages PMTs from X-walls and gamma veto.

 \vskip 10pt  A crate contains  up to  20 16-channel boards.   A board
 inherits the  number of the crate  it is plugged into  and is located
 through its slot number.  We propose  to label a given board with the
 following scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{B:$crate$.$board$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$crate$} is the number of the crate and \texttt{$board$}
is  the  number  of  the  board  (slot)  ranging  from  \texttt{0}  to
\texttt{20}  except  number  \texttt{10}  which is  reserved  for  the
control board slot number.
\vskip 10pt
\par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{B:0.0}},  \dots
\fbox{\texttt{B:1.11}}.

\vskip 10pt  \par\noindent Up  to 16 channels  are addressed  within a
board.  We propose to label a given channel with the following scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{H:$crate$.$board$.$channel$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$crate$} is the number of the crate, \texttt{$board$} is
the number  of the board  in the  crate and \texttt{$channel$}  is the
number  of  the  channel  in  the board  ranging  from  \texttt{0}  to
\texttt{15}.   \par\noindent Examples:  \fbox{\texttt{H:0.0.0}}, \dots
\fbox{\texttt{H:1.19.12}}

\vskip  10pt A  channel is  automatically associated  to a specific
cable number in a given harness.

\subsection{Harnesses and cables}

One uses 2$\times$22  harnesses to group individual  channels from the
front-end boards to the PMTs.

\vskip 10pt  A signal  external harness connects  a set  of individual
channels on  several frontend boards  to the patch panel.  An external
harness has an  unique ID ranging from \texttt{0}  to \texttt{21}.  We
propose to label a given external harness with the following scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{E:$harness$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$harness$} is the number of the external harness.
\par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{E:0}}, \dots
\fbox{\texttt{E:21}}

\vskip 10pt  A signal  internal harness, connecting  patch panel  to a
given  set of  PMTs  uses  an unique  ID  ranging  from \texttt{0}  to
\texttt{21}.  We  propose to label  a given external harness  with the
following scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{I:$harness$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$harness$} is the number of the external harness.
\par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{I:0}}, \dots
\fbox{\texttt{I:21}}
\vskip 10pt A internal harness with a given number is associated
to a external harness with the same number.

\vskip 10pt Each  external or internal harness groups up  to 40 signal
cables identified through  a cable ID from  \texttt{0} to \texttt{39}.
We propose to label a given external cable with the following scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{A:$harness$.$cable$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$harness$} is the number of the external harness
and \texttt{$cable$} is the number of the external cable.
\par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{A:0.0}}, \dots
\fbox{\texttt{A:21.15}}.

Internal cables use a similar scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{L:$harness$.$cable$}}
\end{center}
\par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{L:0.0}}, \dots
\fbox{\texttt{L:21.15}}.

Internal and external signal cables  connected through the patch panel
share the  same harness  and cable numbers.  Thus, the  internal cable
\fbox{\texttt{A:7.12}}   is   connected    to   the   external   cable
\fbox{\texttt{L:7.12}}.
