  \noindent This document presents the cable labelling convention used
  for  the SuperNEMO  Demonstrator's Calorimeter  High Voltage  System
  (CaloHV).  We reuse  here some informations available  from a couple
  of documents prepared  by Cedric and Mathieu,  with some adaptations
  and addons.

\section{Principle}

The SuperNEMO Demonstrator's Calorimeter  High Voltage System (CaloHV)
uses two CAEN High  Voltage crates which host a total  of 24 boards to
distribute HV to 712 PMTs.

Each HV board manages up to 32 channels and is connected to a specific
set of  PMTs through  a pair  of harnesses.   A first  harness, called
\emph{external harness}, links the board  to a single connector on the
patch panel (external side). From this connector on the patch panel, a
new harness, namely the \emph{internal  harness}, routes HV channel to
the PMTs.  The end of the  \emph{internal harness} is designed in such
a way cables can be routed  indivudually to their associated PMTs.  Of
course, a given harness handles a  set of PMTs that are geographically
close to each other, in order to optimize the length of the cables.

In the present  scheme, it has been decided to  identify individual HV
distribution cables using  the pin identifiers on  the connectors they
are associated  to.  Ideally, the  pin number  on the HV  board output
connector thus identifies the cable  linked to it.  This identifier is
propagated to the pin number on the patch panel connectors then to the
end  of the  cable linked  to the  PMT. This  enables to  build rather
simple and comprehensible cabling tables.

\noindent\par  Figure  \ref{fig:calohv:principle:1}  shows  the  basic
diagram of  the CaloHV  system. A dedicated  labelling system  will be
used to ease the cabling operations.

\section{Addressing objects}

\subsection{Format of a CaloHV label}

Each label to be used for CaloHV cabling will use the following format:

\begin{center}
  \fbox{\texttt{X:}$id_1$.$id_2$\dots$id_n$}
\end{center}
\noindent  where \texttt{X}  is a  single letter  which describes  the
category  of the  labelled  object,  and the  $id_1$.$id_2$\dots$id_n$
sequence is the unique address of the object within its category.  The
$id_x$ tokens are positive integers (possibly zero).  The \emph{colon}
character is  used to separate  the category letter from  the address.
The  sequence  of  identifiers  in  the  address  use  the  \emph{dot}
character as a separator.


\subsection{HV crates, boards, channel, harnesses and cables}

Each HV power supply crate belonging to the CaloHV system is installed
in the rack number 2 on the electronics platform.
A crate is identified with an unique ID, namely
a number ranging from \texttt{0} to \texttt{1}.  We propose to label a
given HV crate with the following scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{C:$crate$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$crate$} is the number of the crate (positive integer).
\vskip     10pt    \par\noindent     Examples:    \fbox{\texttt{C:0}},
\fbox{\texttt{C:1}}.  \par Conventionally, crate \texttt{0} manages HV
for PMTs on the \emph{Italy} side  and crate \texttt{1} manages HV for
PMTs on the \emph{France} side.

\vskip 10pt A crate contains up to 16 HV 32-channel boards but only 12
will be  used.  A  HV board  inherits the  number of  the crate  it is
plugged into  and is located through  its slot number.  We  propose to
label a given HV board with the following scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{B:$crate$.$board$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$crate$} is the number of the crate and \texttt{$board$}
is  the  number  of  the  board  (slot)  ranging  from  \texttt{0}  to
\texttt{15}.
\vskip 10pt
\par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{B:0.0}},  \dots
\fbox{\texttt{B:1.11}}.

\vskip 10pt
\par\noindent Up  to 32 HV channels are addressed within a HV board.
 We propose to label a given HV channel with the following scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{H:$crate$.$board$.$channel$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$crate$} is the number of the crate,
  \texttt{$board$} is the number of the crate
and  \texttt{$channel$} is the number of the channel
ranging from
\texttt{0} to \texttt{31}.
\par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{H:0.0.0}}, \dots
\fbox{\texttt{H:1.11.31}}

\vskip 10pt
A HV channel is automatically associated to specific pin number of
the output connector of the HV board. 

\vskip 10pt A  HV external harness connecting a given  HV board to the
patch panel uses an unique  ID ranging from \texttt{0} to \texttt{23}.
We propose  to label a  given HV  external harness with  the following
scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{E:$harness$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$harness$} is the number of the external harness.
\par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{E:0}}, \dots
\fbox{\texttt{E:23}}

\vskip 10pt Compared with the  labelling scheme proposed by Mathieu in
original  documents,  it   has  been  decided  not   to  introduce  an
intermediate cable  identifier depending on  the location of  the PMTs
(main walls,  top row in  main walls,  X-walls, gamma veto rows).  A unique
scheme   is  used in place,   based   on  an   already  existing   informations,
independently of  the geometry.  Individual cables  within an external
harness are identified through the  pin numbers they are associated to
on  the   HV  board  output  connector.    This  pin/cable  identifier
propagates up  to the  patch panel  and beyond  to the  internal cable
terminations.  There is no need  to label internal cables because they
are   confined  within   their  harness   and  thus   never  addressed
individually during cabling operations.




%%optical  fiber nnnnnnnninherits  the number of  the LED  it is

%% bundle thanks  to an  additional \emph{fiber  number}.  We  propose to

%% \begin{center}
%%   \fbox{\texttt{P:$led$.$fib$}}\hskip 1cm or\hskip 1cm\fbox{\texttt{S:$led$.$fib$}}
%% \end{center}
%% where \texttt{$led$} is the number  of the LED (and bundle) associated
%% to the fiber and \texttt{$fib$} is  the number of the fiber within the
%% bundle  (starting at  1). The  leading \texttt{P}  is used  for fibers
%% connected to the \emph{primary} connector of a scintillator block; the
%% \texttt{S}  is  used  for  fibers connected  to  the  \emph{secondary}
%% connector of a scintillator block.

\subsection{Optical modules}

The  identification scheme  of the  optical  modules is  based on  the
addressing scheme defined in the geometry model and implemented in the
simulation     and     data    analysis     software\footnote{Falaise:
  \url{https://gitub.com/SuperNEMO-DBD/Falaise}}.     There   are    4
categories  of  optical  modules  and  thus  of  scintillator  blocks,
depending on their location in the experimental setup:

\begin{itemize}
  
\item Main wall block (Falaise: geometry category \texttt{"calorimeter\_block"}
  and  type  \texttt{1302}):

  \par  OMs are  addressed  through  their
  \emph{side}   number from 0 (Italy)     to  1 (France),
  \emph{column} number from 0 (Edelweiss) to 19 (Tunnel) and
  \emph{row}    number from 0 (bottom)    to 12 (top).

  \par We  propose to label such a block with the following scheme:
  \begin{center}
    \fbox{\texttt{M:$side$.$column$.$row$}}
  \end{center}
  \vskip 10pt
  \par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{M:0.0.0}}, 
  \fbox{\texttt{M:0.19.12}}, \fbox{\texttt{M:1.0.0}}, \fbox{\texttt{M:1.19.12}}.
  
\item X-wall block (Falaise: geometry category \texttt{"xcalo\_block"} and type
  \texttt{1232}):
  
  \par OMs  are addressed  through their
  \emph{side}   number from 0 (Italy)     to  1 (France),
  \emph{wall}   number from 0 (Edelweiss) to  1 (tunnel),
  \emph{column} number from 0 (source)    to  1 (calorimeter) and
  \emph{row}    number from 0 (bottom)    to 15 (top).
  
  \par  We propose  to
  label such a block with the following scheme:
  \begin{center}
    \fbox{\texttt{X:$side$.$wall$.$column$.$row$}}
  \end{center}
  \vskip 10pt
  \par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{X:0.1.1.15}}, \fbox{\texttt{X:1.0.0.8}}
  
\item Gamma veto block  (Falaise: geometry category \texttt{"gveto\_block"} and
  type   \texttt{1252}):
  
  \par   OMs  are   addressed  through   their
  \emph{side}   number from 0 (Italy)     to  1 (France),
  \emph{wall}   number from 0 (bottom)    to  1 (top)  and
  \emph{column} number from 0 (Edelweiss) to 15 (tunnel).
  
  \par We propose to label  such a block
  with the following scheme:
  \begin{center}
    \fbox{\texttt{G:$side$.$wall$.$column$}}
  \end{center}
  \vskip 10pt
  
  \par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{G:0.1.0}}, \fbox{\texttt{G:1.0.8}}
  
\item  Block for  reference  optical module:
  
  \par  OMs are  addressed  through their \emph{ref}  number.
  
  \par We propose to  label such a  block with the following scheme:
  \begin{center}
    \fbox{\texttt{R:$ref$}}
  \end{center}
