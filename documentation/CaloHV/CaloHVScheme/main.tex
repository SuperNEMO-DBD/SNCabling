  \noindent This document presents the cable labelling convention used
  for  the SuperNEMO  Demonstrator's Calorimeter  High Voltage  System
  (CaloHV).  We reuse  here some informations available  from a couple
  of documents prepared  by Cedric and Mathieu,  with some adaptations
  and addons.

\section{Principle}

The SuperNEMO Demonstrator's Calorimeter  High Voltage System (CaloHV)
uses two CAEN High  Voltage crates which host a total  of 24 boards to
distribute HV to 712 PMTs.

Each HV board manages up to 32 channels and is connected to a specific
set of  PMTs through  a pair  of harnesses.   A first  harness, called
\emph{external harness}, links the board  to a single connector on the
patch panel (external side). From this connector on the patch panel, a
new harness, namely the \emph{internal  harness}, routes HV channel to
the PMTs.  The end of the  \emph{internal harness} is designed in such
a way cables can be routed  indivudually to their associated PMTs.  Of
course, a given harness handles a  set of PMTs that are geographically
close to each other, in order to optimize the length of the cables.

In the present  scheme, it has been decided to  identify individual HV
distribution cables using  the pin identifiers on  the connectors they
are associated  to.  Ideally, the  pin number  on the HV  board output
connector thus identifies the cable  linked to it.  This identifier is
propagated to the pin number on the patch panel connectors then to the
end  of the  cable linked  to the  PMT. This  enables to  build rather
simple and comprehensible cabling tables.

\noindent\par  Figure  \ref{fig:calohv:principle:1}  shows  the  basic
diagram of  the CaloHV  system. A dedicated  labelling system  will be
used to ease the cabling operations.
