\subsection{Format of a CaloHV label}

Each label to be used for CaloHV cabling will use the following format:

\begin{center}
  \fbox{\texttt{X:}$id_1$.$id_2$\dots$id_n$}
\end{center}
\noindent  where \texttt{X}  is a  single letter  which describes  the
category  of the  labelled  object,  and the  $id_1$.$id_2$\dots$id_n$
sequence is the unique address of the object within its category.  The
$id_x$ tokens are positive integers (possibly zero).  The \emph{colon}
character is  used to separate  the category letter from  the address.
The  sequence  of  identifiers  in  the  address  uses  the  \emph{dot}
character as a separator.


\subsection{HV crates, boards, channel, harnesses and cables}

Each CAEN HV power supply crate belonging to the CaloHV system is installed
in the rack number 2 on the electronics platform.
A HV crate is identified with an unique ID, namely
a number ranging from \texttt{0} to \texttt{1}.  We propose to label a
given HV crate with the following scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{C:$crate$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$crate$} is the number of the crate (positive integer).
\vskip     10pt    \par\noindent     Examples:    \fbox{\texttt{C:0}},
\fbox{\texttt{C:1}}.  \par Conventionally, crate \texttt{0} manages HV
for PMTs on the \emph{Italy} side  and crate \texttt{1} manages HV for
PMTs on the \emph{France} side.

\vskip 10pt A HV crate contains up to 16 HV 32-channel boards but only 12
will be  used.  A  HV board  inherits the  number of  the crate  it is
plugged into  and is addressed through  its slot number.  We give a given HV board
a label with the following scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{B:$crate$.$board$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$crate$} is the number of the crate and \texttt{$board$}
is  the  number  of  the  board  (slot)  ranging  from  \texttt{0}  to
\texttt{15}.
\vskip 10pt
\par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{B:0.0}},  \dots
\fbox{\texttt{B:1.11}}.

\vskip 10pt
\par\noindent Up  to 32 HV channels are addressed within a HV board.
 We propose to label a given HV channel with the following scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{H:$crate$.$board$.$channel$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$crate$} is the number of the crate,
  \texttt{$board$} is the number of the crate
and  \texttt{$channel$} is the number of the channel
ranging from
\texttt{0} to \texttt{31}.
\par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{H:0.0.0}}, \dots
\fbox{\texttt{H:1.11.31}}

\vskip 10pt
A HV channel is automatically associated to a specific pin number of
the output connector of the CAEN HV board. 

\vskip 10pt A external HV  harness  connecting a given HV board (Radial
connector) to the patch panel (Redel  Male S connector) uses an unique
ID  ranging from  \texttt{0} to  \texttt{23}.  We give to each
external HV harness a label with the following scheme:
\begin{center}
   \fbox{\texttt{E:$harness$}}
 \end{center}
where \texttt{$harness$} is the number of the external harness.
\par\noindent Examples: \fbox{\texttt{E:0}}, \dots
\fbox{\texttt{E:23}}

\vskip 10pt Compared with the  labelling scheme proposed by Mathieu in
original  documents,  it   has  been  decided  not   to  introduce  an
intermediate cable  identifier depending on  the location of  the PMTs
(main walls,  top row in  main walls,  X-walls, gamma veto rows).  A unique
scheme   is  used in place,   based   on  an   already  existing   informations,
independently of  the geometry.  Individual cables  within an external
harness are identified through the  pin numbers they are associated to
on  the   HV  board  output  connector.    This  pin/cable  identifier
propagates up  to the  patch panel  and beyond  to the  internal cable
terminations.  There is no need  to label internal cables because they
are   confined  within   their  harness   and  thus   never  addressed
individually during cabling operations.
